                            <p>Coding is awesome! As a web developer I'm able
                            to creatively
                            enhance the
                            web, improving the user experience and optimizing web performance.
                            A great business sense and an eye for troubleshooting are
                            just a couple of the strengths that I bring to
                            the
                            table. I
                            find it very
                            rewarding to take part in building, refactoring and maintaining something so vital to
                            connecting our world.
                        </p>
                            <p>I'm looking forward to contributing my thirst for knowledge and growing skill set to a
                            company that is
                            pushing
                            the
                            boundaries of technology and utilizing the incredible possiblities of coding. When I'm
                            not writing code, I'm
                            cooking and staying fit. I also love to travel - I'm always ready for an
                            adventure.</p>
